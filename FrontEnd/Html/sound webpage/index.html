                 Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. 
                 Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal. While scholars agree
                 that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definition. The creation of music is commonly divided into 
                 musical composition, improvisation, and performance, though the topic extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology.
                 Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.
